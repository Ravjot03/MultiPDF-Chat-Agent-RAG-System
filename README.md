# MultiPDF Chat Agent RAG-System

The Multi-PDF Chat Agent is a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built in Python and Streamlit that enables users to:

- Upload multiple PDF documents
- Ask natural language questions
- Receive answers grounded in the PDF content

It uses Google Gemini 1.5 Pro as the language model and FAISS as the vector database to implement a highly responsive and accurate question-answering system over unstructured data.
