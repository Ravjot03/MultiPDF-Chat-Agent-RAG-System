# MultiPDF Chat Agent RAG-System

The Multi-PDF Chat Agent is a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built in Python and Streamlit that enables users to:

- Upload multiple PDF documents
- Ask natural language questions
- Receive answers grounded in the PDF content

It uses Google Gemini 1.5 Pro as the language model and FAISS as the vector database to implement a highly responsive and accurate question-answering system over unstructured data.

## Problem it is solving 
PDFs are rich sources of information but hard to query efficiently. This project allows users to interact with their documents as if talking to a smart assistant â€” instantly retrieving and summarizing the most relevant information.

Use cases:
1. Legal document review
2. Scientific paper Q&A
3. Business report understanding
4. Internal knowledge base search
5. RFP/documentation analysis
